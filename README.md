BSP Map Tools for Unity game engine by John Evans evans3d512@gmail.com

With these tools, you can use map editors like Trenchbroom, Jack(Jackhammer) and Radiant to build levels for Unity.
Importer loads Quake 3 format ".map" or ".bsp" file, and builds a complete game ready level, with all propper geometry optimization, lightmap uvs,
collision geometry, all custom entities, and just everything. The main map model is split into smaller models that fit well into lightmaps and occlusion culling, based on mesh surface area.
Brush entities like doors, elevators and detail objects, become separate models. The package also includes high quality first person movement controller, and basic entity scripts for
doors, buttons and elevators.

**This is only the code, the package is here: https://github.com/JohnEvans512/UBSPMapTools/releases**

For usage instructions see UBSPMaual.txt

The tools are completely free and fully functional, but it could still use some work and propper documentation.
So if you find this thing useful, and have a few dollars to spare, please do, it will be extremely helpful.
